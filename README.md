<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Project Working](screenshot1.png)](screenshot1.png)
[![Second Picture](screenshot2.png)](screenshot2.png)

This is a JavaFX program that uses [Sarxos Webcam Capture API](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture) and [Tesseract OCR Engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to capture credit card image using webcam, parse the numbers in it, and then check the validity of these credit card numbers. It employs an implementation of [Luhn's Algorithm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) to validate the credit card numbers.



### Built With
This project is entirely built with the following components and languages:
* [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io)
* [Sarxos Webcam Capture API](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture)
* [Tesseract OCR Engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
* [JavaCPP Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the program up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Java Runtime Environment(JRE)>=8 and Apache Maven should be installed. After installation, check their versions using

```sh
java --version
mvn --version
```


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vijethph/credit-card-validation.git
```
2. Open the downloaded folder
```sh
cd credit-card-validation
```
3. Install the packages required using the following command:
```sh
mvn clean install
```
4. Finally run the program using
```sh
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="WebcamAppLauncher"
```
You can also download the jar file in [Releases](https://github.com/vijethph/credit-card-validation/releases) section and run it by using:
```sh
java pkg.jar
```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once the application starts, perform the following steps:

1. Select one of the available webcams in the dropdown list.
2. Capture the image of credit card with its numbers properly displayed.
3. Click "Perform OCR" to parse the digits.
4. You can edit the number in case of an error, and check validity of credit card number.
